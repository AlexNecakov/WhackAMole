# FPGA Whack-A-Mole - 2019

This is the project code for an FPGA-based Whack-A-Mole game. This project was done for the Introduction to Logic Design course during my undergrad, in collaboration with Shaivya Gupta, George Kent-Scheller, and Tony Faller. Development was done in Vivado for the [Digilent Nexys A7](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/start) FPGA platform. Deployment follows typical Vivado deployment procedures. My personal role on the project was to create the overall architecture, coordinate module creation and linkage, and final implementation of the top level module and state machine. Included are testbenches for various modules for debugging. The game is played by using the various toggle switches on the Nexys board as "hammers" to turn off or on indicator lights (representing moles). The game runs for a set period of time before the score is finalized.
